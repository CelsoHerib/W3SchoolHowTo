# W3Scholl

W3Schools is a website dedicated to publishing information for web developers, specifically in publishing tutorials and references related to languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL.
 The site was launched in 1999 by the Norwegian company Refsnes Data and is named after the abbreviation for the World Wide Web, i.e. three times W (W3) followed by the word schools.

W3Schools offers hundreds of code samples and allows users to test and modify these samples using an online editor.
 In addition, useful tools such as a color picker and a “try it yourself” feature facilitate experimentation and learning.
